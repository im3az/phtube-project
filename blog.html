          Discuss the scope of var, let, and const:
        </li>
        <p class="text-[#5D5D5D] text-xl font-medium ml-12 mt-4">
          Var, let, and const are keywords for declaring variables in
          JavaScript. They have different scopes and behaviors. <br /><br />

          Var variables are scoped to the immediate function body or the global
          scope. They can be updated and re-declared within their scope. They
          are also hoisted, meaning they can be accessed before they are
          declared123. <br /><br />
          Let variables are scoped to the nearest block (such as a loop or an if
          statement). They can be updated but not re-declared within their
          scope. They are not hoisted, meaning they cannot be accessed before
          they are declared1234. <br /><br />
          Const variables are also scoped to the nearest block. They cannot be
          updated or re-declared within their scope. They are not hoisted
          either. They must be initialized with a value when they are
          declared1234. <br /><br />
          Some style guides recommend using const over let whenever a variable
          is not reassigned in its scope, to make the intent clear that a
          variable's type or value can never change4.

          Tell us the use cases of null and undefined:
        </li>
        <p class="text-[#5D5D5D] text-xl font-medium ml-12 mt-4">
          Null and undefined are two special values in JavaScript that represent
          the absence of a meaningful value. However, they have different
          meanings and use cases. <br />
          <br />

          Null is used to indicate that a variable has been explicitly assigned
          to have no value. It is often used to represent the intentional
          absence of an object. undefined is used to indicate that a variable
          has not been assigned a value at all, or that a property does not
          exist on an object. It is often used to represent the unintentional
          absence of a value. <br />
          <br />
          For example, you can use null to indicate that a function parameter is
          optional, or that a callback function has no error. You can use
          undefined to check if a variable has been declared, or if an array
          element is missing.

          What do you mean by REST API?
        </li>
        <p class="text-[#5D5D5D] text-xl font-medium ml-12 mt-4">
          A REST API is a way for applications or devices to communicate with
          each other using a set of rules and principles. REST stands for
          representational state transfer and it is a style of software
          architecture. A REST API consists of resources that can be identified
          by URLs and can be manipulated using HTTP methods such as GET, POST,
          PUT, DELETE, etc.
